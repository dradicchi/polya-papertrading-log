# Methodological Disclosures — Polya Paper Trading v2

This document records methodological corrections applied during the
public paper trading run. The paper trading log (`events.jsonl` and
`positions/`) is preserved as-is — including data collected before
each correction. This file is the audit trail for what was wrong, when
it was found, and what was fixed.

The principle: transparency over silent revision. Every entry in
`events.jsonl` is real; this document tells you which subset was
collected under fixed-since methodology and which under since-corrected
methodology.

The strategy ruleset itself is proprietary and not published in this
repository (see `README.md`, "Strategy rules"). The disclosures below
describe *that* a methodological gap existed, *when* it was active,
and *what was the impact* — without revealing the specific filter
values or model parameters.

## 2026-04-15 (session 48): Universe alignment

### Affected window

- **Start:** 2026-04-13 21:41 UTC (first entry of paper trading v2)
- **End:** 2026-04-15 ~22:00 UTC (all four corrections deployed)
- **Affected entries:** ~87 (all entries before commit `<B188-commit>`)

### What was wrong, in plain language

Four progressively-tightened gaps in the real-time scoring layer
caused the paper trading universe to diverge from the canonical
universe used in the backtest that produced the published track
record. The gaps did not affect the *pricing* of any contract — they
affected *which contracts* were considered for entry, and *which model*
was used to evaluate them.

The four gaps were:

1. **Moneyness filter not enforced.** The strategy is short OTM CALL
   (publicly stated in `README.md`), but the real-time scorer did not
   reject in-the-money or extreme deep-out-of-the-money contracts
   before scoring. As a result, a small number of positions were
   opened in moneyness ranges where the strategy was not designed to
   operate.
2. **Cross-universe scoring.** Each model in the backtest is trained
   on a single Deribit `settlement_period` (one of `day`, `week`,
   `month`). The real-time scorer classified contracts into horizons
   by their time-to-expiry instead of by their `settlement_period`.
   As a result, contracts of one settlement_period were sometimes
   scored by a model trained on contracts of a different
   settlement_period.
3. **Operational filters not enforced.** The backtest applies
   horizon-specific operational filters on top of the model's
   training range (a moneyness ceiling, a maximum time-to-expiry,
   and a near-expiry guard). The real-time scorer was using only
   the model's calibration range, which is wider. The strategy was
   therefore considering contracts that the backtest excludes.
4. **Filter values were duplicated** across the backtest scripts and
   the paper trader rather than read from a single source of truth.
   Items 1–3 above were all symptoms of this duplication: changes to
   the backtest filters had not been propagated to the paper trader.

### Quantification of the affected entries

Of the 87 entries in the affected window:

- **62 entries (71%)** were already correctly classified — the
  contract's `settlement_period` matched the horizon under which it
  was entered. These are unaffected by the cross-universe correction.
- **25 entries (29%)** were cross-universe. Specifically:
  - 16 entries booked under the `daily` horizon were `week`
    contracts
  - 5 entries booked under `weekly` were `month` contracts
  - 4 entries booked under `weekly` were `day` contracts
- A small number of entries (single digits across all horizons) were
  outside the operational moneyness range that the backtest enforces.

### Realized P&L impact: zero

All 12 closed trades as of 2026-04-15 are correctly-classified
`daily` × `day` matches. **No closed trade is from a cross-universe
or out-of-range entry.** The realized track record up to the
correction date is clean.

### Open positions at fix time

Approximately 25 open positions were cross-universe at the moment of
the fix. **They were not manually closed.** Two reasons:

1. The trades themselves are real and economically valid contracts —
   only their *interpretation* (which model selected them) is wrong.
   The underlying option pricing is universal across horizons.
2. They will resolve naturally via the strategy's existing exit logic
   (deterministic, rule-based — see `README.md`).

### Going forward

All entries from 2026-04-15 ~22:00 UTC onward operate under the
canonical universe. The four gaps above are closed by code-level
fixes in the research repository and a single shared source of truth
for filter values across both the backtest and the paper trader.

The first weekly report covering the affected window will include a
methodological footnote pointing to this document; subsequent reports
will not.

### Capital pot resize (related housekeeping)

Independently of the universe alignment above, on 2026-04-15 the
capital pot was resized from **9.6 BTC** (the value listed in the
prior version of `README.md`) to **20 BTC**, after observing that the
realized fill rate during the first 28 hours of operation was higher
than the original projection. The resize is conservative: the
projected steady-state initial margin requirement was below 16 BTC
and 25% buffer takes it to 20.

This is not a methodological correction — the original 9.6 BTC was
not "wrong", just smaller than what the operational fill rate
required. It is documented here for completeness because `README.md`
mentions the pot size as a public fact.

### Why the gaps existed

The real-time scoring infrastructure was created shortly before the
paper trading go-live. The author copied the model's training range
from the calibration metadata but did not port the *operational*
filters from the backtest scripts (which were thought of as the
"strategy layer", separate from "scoring"). In paper trading v2, the
scorer is also the eligibility gate — there is no separate strategy
layer between scoring and entry — so the missing operational filters
silently degraded the universe.

The gaps were detected during a routine diagnostic of the first 28
hours of paper trading data, not by a production failure or by an
external audit.

### Audit trail

- Universe corrections: backlog items B183, B184, B186, B188
  (internal references)
- Conceptual principle: the canonical universe and the selection /
  exit rules are shared between the backtest and the paper trader;
  the paper trader is allowed to sophisticate only the *operational
  mechanics* (e.g., the cadence of scoring cycles), not the rules
  themselves
- 495 unit tests passing as of 2026-04-15
- Test coverage for the universe alignment: included

### How to verify (independently of the research repo)

Anyone auditing this repo can cross-check the disclosures against
`events.jsonl`:

- The affected window is `entry` events with
  `ts_utc < 2026-04-15T22:00:00Z`
- For each entry, the contract's `settlement_period` can be retrieved
  via Deribit's public API:
  `https://www.deribit.com/api/v2/public/get_instrument?instrument_name=<name>`
- Compare the returned `settlement_period` (`day`, `week`, `month`)
  against the `horizon` field in the entry. The expected mapping is
  `day` → `daily`, `week` → `weekly`, `month` → `monthly`. Mismatches
  are the cross-universe entries.
- The number of mismatches in the affected window matches the count
  reported in this document (25 of 87).

### Pot size verification

The pot size at any moment can be inferred from `events.jsonl` by
summing the `im_btc` field of all open positions and adding the
`im_available_btc` field of the most recent `rejected_no_capital`
event (if any). The resize from 9.6 → 20 BTC will be visible as a
discontinuity in the maximum committed initial margin around
2026-04-15.
